## Hi, here is Antares

I'm a graduate student in Nanjing University, major in Mathematics. My research field is [statistical learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory). I'm also interested in software development but is a bad coder. I also like algorithms, ~~and I'm doing leetcode using C++~~.

My personal website is [chr.fan](https://chr.fan/). Telegram channel: [Antares At Home](https://t.me/AntaresAtHome).

My Reversi AI is deployed on my website [reversi.chr.fan](http://reversi.chr.fan), please feel free to battle with them.

The language I like best is Python **only with TYPE HINTS**, since I feel very free when writing and running codes.

I am also a fan of
