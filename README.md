I was a graduate student in Nanjing University, major in Mathematics. My research field was reinforcement learning. Currently I'm a game developer.

My personal website is [chr.fan](https://chr.fan/).

My Reversi AI is deployed on my website [reversi.chr.fan](http://reversi.chr.fan), please feel free to play with them.

I am good at C++, but I don't like its design. The language I like best is Python, but **only with TYPE HINTS**.

I am currently working on MiraiCP, a C++ SDK for QQ bot framework mirai; also my Reversi AI and other personal C++ libraries.

I am also a fan of
