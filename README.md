I was a graduate student in Nanjing University, major in Mathematics. My research field was reinforcement learning. Currently I'm a game engine developer focusing on performance optimization.

My personal website is [chr.fan](https://chr.fan/).

I am good at C++, but I don't like its design. The language I like best is Python, but **only with TYPE HINTS**.

I use ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/NixOS-5277C3?style=for-the-badge&logo=NixOS&logoColor=white) for developing, BTW.

I am also a fan of
